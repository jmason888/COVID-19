COVID-19 Data Dashboard, in Shiny

There are other data dashboards out there, and I use some of their same data sources, where available. This project is an exercise in data visualization, and particularly in showing the data *I* am interested in, in the way *I* want to see it.

Additionally, with temporary unavailability of (portions of) official data sources, it is important to be able to make use of alternate sources.
